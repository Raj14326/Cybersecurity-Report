# Cybersecurity-Report
Detailed Cybersecurity Report including ScreenShots of the vulnerabilities and tools used to replicate it.

Cybersecurity as a whole is an emerging concept in the field of technology and that too a very important one. Every piece of document, transaction, receipt, and any piece of paper that you might have is or will be digitalized soon following your entire life being digitized, therefore having security on the digital front has become a must for today's world. If anyone wants to feel secure and safeguarded the first step to follow is to secure the digital assets owned by the user. Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in this front by providing security as well as a sense of freedom while performing any actions in the vast digital landscape known as cyberspace.

I have performed certain operations and exploits on a local network that have helped me determine the most common and yet most possible cybersecurity attacks that can be performed on a network. The aim of this report is to educate users on the various threats that these exploits pose to their network and to what degree their system can be affected and exploited by a malicious hacker.

Following are the tools ( along with their download links ) that I used to perform the various cybersecurity operations :

# MyLanViewer
MyLanViewer Network/IP Scanner is a powerful IP address scanner for the local area network (LAN). This application will help you find all IP addresses, MAC addresses, and shared folders of computers on your wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) network. The program scans the network and displays your network computers in an easy-to-read, buddy-list style window that provides the computer name, IP address, MAC address, NIC vendor, OS version, logged users, shared folders, and other technical details for each computer. It is able to monitor your external IP address and send email notifications when it changes. MyLanViewer Network/IP Scanner can also turn on and off remote computers, view and control your shared folders, terminate user sessions, show netstat information, detect rogue DHCP servers, and other network tools. The software can monitor all devices (even hidden) on your subnet, and send alerts when new devices will be found (for example, to know who is connected to your WiFi router or wireless network). The program is easy to install and use and has a user-friendly and beautiful interface.

# PsExec

PsExec is a lightweight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software. 
PsExec's most powerful uses include launching interactive command-prompts on remote systems and remote-enabling tools like IpConfig that otherwise do not have the ability to show information about remote systems.

# MetaSploit

The Metasploit framework is a very powerful tool that can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers. Because itâ€™s an open-source framework, it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems. With Metasploit, the pen testing team can use ready-made or custom code and introduce it into a network to probe for weak spots. As another flavor of threat hunting, once flaws are identified and documented, the information can be used to address systemic weaknesses and prioritize solutions.

# AngryIPScanner

Angry IP Scanner (or simply ipscan) is an open-source and cross-platform network scanner designed to be fast and simple to use. It scans IP addresses and ports as well as has many other features.
It is widely used by network administrators and just curious users around the world, including large and small enterprises, banks, and government agencies.
It runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, possibly supporting other platforms as well.
